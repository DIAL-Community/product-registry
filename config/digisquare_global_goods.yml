  - name: OpenMRS
    description: OpenMRS is a software platform and a reference application that enables design of a customized medical records system (MRS). It is a common platform upon which health informatics and eHealth efforts in low- income countries can be built. Since the system is based on a conceptual database structure that is not dependent on the actual types of medical information required to be collected or on particular data collection forms, it can be customized for different uses. Both the platform and the new front-end reference application (OpenMRS 3.x) are designed to be modular, making it extremely extensible by allowing customizations to be added or removed to meet local needs. OpenMRS is based on the principle that information should be stored in a way that makes it easy to summarize and analyze (i.e., minimal use of free text and maximum use of coded information). At its core, it is a concept dictionary that stores all diagnoses, tests, procedures, drugs, and other general questions and potential answers.

  - name: iHRIS
    description: Many countries experience critical shortages of health workers and struggle to meet the health care needs of their people. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this problem, making it more difficult for health workers to deliver lifesaving, people-centered care. Effective health workforce management is crucial for countries to address these gaps. Human resources managers and other decision-makers require up-to- date and accurate data on the current number of health workers, where they are deployed, their skill sets, and information on vacant posts and migration. Yet many countries lack this information in a central database, making it difficult to locate employee records or aggregate data for analysis. iHRIS is a free and open source software solution that has been used by ministries of health, district health offices, and health care facilities in over 30 countries to more easily collect, maintain, analyze, and manage health workforce data and resources.

    description: OpenLabConnect is a decoupled mediator that transports and transforms data and commands between laboratory test instruments and laboratory information systems (LIS). Collecting data from laboratory analyzer instruments can be time consuming and highly subject to error due to manual transcription between the order, the machine, and the results report. Additionally, precise algorithms and rules for quality assurance and validation are often haphazardly followed by staff. Historically, much of the digital interfacing with instruments has been custom and tightly coupled to its software through point-to-point programming. OpenLabConnect can be used as a generalized solution to bridge the LIS and the laboratory analyzer exchange to mitigate these issues.
